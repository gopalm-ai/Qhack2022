# Qhack2022

### Project Description:
In this project, we will use Quantum Neural Network along with classical layers to create Hybrid Neural network using Pennylane & Tensorflow & Amazon Braket platform to present the state of the art of quantum algorithms for Financial applications, with particular focus to use cases on Continuous variable prediction problems for example Asset price prediction. We will use Boston housing data taken from the StatLib library maintained at Carnegie Mellon University

Quantum Machine Learning is an emerging field that promises to solve intractable problems. There are multiple quantum machine learning algorithms that have emerged from their classical counterparts. Specially the so-called Quantum Neural Networks.

The aim of this project is to develop a clear understanding of the promises and limitations of the current state-of-the-art of quantum algorithms for machine learning, also to define directions for future research in this exciting field. And then draw the parallels to recent ‘quantum-inspired’ results, and explain the implications of these results for quantum machine learning applications. Looking for areas which might bear larger advantages for QML algorithms.
